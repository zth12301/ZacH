/* Page Plans:
    Home - general summary of me including generalized bit of resume, keep simple but don't leave the screen barren. Also have photo of self
           Also have links to things in home.
    Projects - List of projects w/ descriptions, what it was made with, and links
    Resume - Try to link to something? figure out, better to do this than need to update manually every time
    Contact - all contact info and other important links */

/* Navigation:
    Home - have my photo top right? maybe just house icon
    Projects - navbar
    Resume - navbar
    Contact - navbar */

/* Dark Mode:
    Button in top left or right? always there, part of the "header" of the page */

/* General look:
    Don't want to copy other websites that I've seen but hard to come up with something purely original
    Probably just put everything in a rectangle and have something going on in the background
    Maybe a cool scroll effect but keep it subtle
    
    Plan for it to be intended to be dark mode, implement light mode later
    
    Maybe also just have each indiviual element be it's own box on a background.
    If this, then no need for multiple different routes, able to just change the boxes.
    Maybe even give it some transition.
    Look into class examples for state management*/
